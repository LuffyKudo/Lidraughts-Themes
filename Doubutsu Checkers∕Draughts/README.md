# Doubutsu Checkers/Draughts (Animal Checkers/Draughts)

[Doubutsu Shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dbutsu_sh%C5%8Dgi) (Animal Shogi)  is a variant of shogi, the Japanese cousin of western chess. It is created by professional shogi players Madoka Kitao and Maiko Fujita with the goal of encouraging and teaching young children play shogi.

And now you can play checkers/draughts using doubutsu shogi's board and pieces on Lidraughts.org!

- Boards and pieces included
- Works with both 8x8 (32 fields) and 10x10 (50 fields) boards
- Works with all variants
- Works with matches, puzzles, analysis and board editor

****Note**: Move guide printed on each pieces does not exactly match with the moveset of Frisian and Frysk! variants (pieces in Frisian and Frysk! can also capture orthogonally) but nevertheless still very much playable.<br>I cannot seem to add seperate pieces for Frisian and Frysk! In case you know how, kindly help by [forking](https://github.com/LuffyKudo/Lidraughts-Themes/fork) the repo and creating a pull request. Thank you and God Bless =>*
