# 19th Century Proposed Checkerboard
In the 19th century, a square board with all the squares rotated forty-five degrees was proposed. Unlike the traditional board, all the squares are used in this board.

And now you can play checkers/draughts using the 19th Century Proposed Checkerboard on Lidraughts!

- Works with both 8x8 (32 fields) and 10x10 (50 fields) boards
- Works with all variants
- Works with matches, puzzles, analysis and board editor
